<p1> On this website you can find information and guidance from Camalaniugan Blogspot regarding the current 
<br> outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019.</p1>
<br><br>
<p1><b>Covid- 19</b> spread like a smoke from a massive fire and become a threshold to create a new normal in education.
	<br> Students are now struggling to adjust to this new normal. They are overburdened with modules and activities.
	<br> The  learning is not being imparted well to the students resulting on lack of knowledge. However, there is that
	<br> so called internet, where we can get such information or explanation on our given activities. 
	<br><br><br> Covid cases is getting worst day by day and it keeps on attacking the education of students. It also and affects the
	<br> student's health. So far, data suggests that children under the age of 18 years represent about the reported cases,
	<br> with  few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease. However, cases of critical illness have been
	<br> reported. As with adults, pre-existing medical conditions have been suggested as a risk factor for severe disease and
	<br> intensive care admission in children. Further, studies are underway to assess the risk of infection in children.
<br><br><br>
<p1> Its has been 2 years since covid changed the world and how we used to live. 
<br> Some of these cases are the disruption of classes all around the world.
<br> And months later the <b>Department of Education(DepEd)</b> announced the 
<br> continuation of classes will continue as a modular 
<br> class and some selected places for online schooling.
<br> But it is now about a year and a few months since the <b>Modular</b> and <b>Online Schooling</b> has started.
<br><h3> What is the situation now? And what are the thoughts of the students that are experiencing this kind of Learning Method?</b></h3></p>

<hr size="5px" width="100%" color="black">

<p1> Our group surveyed 10 students per Barangay in the area of Camalaniugan,
<br> Which is from Barangay Sapping, Barangay Baggao, Barangay Dugo, and Barangay Agusi.
<br> We asked them the same questions like; <b>Do you have any complaints regarding the Modular and Online Learning?</b>

<br><br><br>

<p1>	The ammount of students that agreed that <b> Modular Learning </b> is not effective is about <p2> 93% </p2>
<br>	of the students surveyed, <p2> 3% </p2> of them are agreed that both learning methods are not effective
<br>	and <p2> 0% </p2> agreed that only <b>Online Learning</b> is not an effective method of learning.
<br>	While some of the students are being surveyed, some parents interfered and said that they also
<br>	dissagree with this kind of Learning method. They are talking about the <u> Modular Learning </u> making problems
<br>	for their children to keep up with the pace of the topic and would eventually fail some of its subjects.

<br><br>Students with learning gap is the most crucial, specially students with lack of materials needed for
<br>	this kind of learning method. Leaving them behind and having nothing learned.

<p1> <b> Student's Replies | Question: For You is Modular Learning Effective? & Is it hard?</b>

<b><br><br> <p1> Question: For You is Modular Learning Effective? </p1></b>

<br><br><br> <b> Student 1 </b> ~ Well for me not much, because lots of students don't understand their lessons,
			<br> 	  they're just answering without analyzing it. And lots of students are just using
			<br>	  Google or Brainly to search for answers and for searching about the lesson instead
			<br>	  of asking their subject teachers. That's why it is <p2>not that effective</p2>

<img src="student.jpg" width="300" style="float:right">

<b><br><br> <p1>Is it hard? </p1></b>

<br><br><br> <b> Student 1 </b> ~ Yes, Because there is a deadline that you need to follow. And it is hard because
			<br> 	  not all can understand the lessons in the module. Even if we ask for our parent's
			<br> 	  help or our guardian's help, we still struggle. Because not all parents had graduated
			<br> 	  or did not have the opportunity to study.


<b><br><br> <p1> Question: For You is Modular Learning Effective? </p1></b>

<br><br><br> <b> Student 2 </b> ~ No,students are having a hard time to do their activities because other student don't
			<br> 	  have gadgets to use to research on a specific info they need. Some of the students now 
			<br> 	  are drowned in social media to flirt with <p3>assholes</p3> that's why some of their 
			<br> 	  modules are not yet finished.
		    <br><br> 	  The good effect of modular learning is that parents don't have to worry about of the 
			<br> 	  allowance of their children, and students can just chill at their houses, the bad effect 
			<br> 	  is that there are so many activities to do, some of students get stress because of it and 
			<br> 	  may lead to depression. Then one day they will just commit suicide. Why the fvck they need 
			<br> 	  to waste their lives if they can just chill and enjoy breathing?

<center>
<h2> <b> BAD EFFECT </h2> </b>

<br>
			<br> 	  The <p2> Bad effect</p2> of Modular Learning is that we don't have much to learn and we
			<br> 	  will just struggle at our lessons. This also adds to our mental health problems. Then the
			<br> 	  others are wasting their time playing and browsing useless things. But these useless things
			<br> 	  are their happiness, the one that relieves them their stress. The problem is many students
			<br> 	  are abusing their use of these. And in some cases they are the cause of eye damages and
			<br> 	  would eventually add to their stress and could cause depression.
		    <br><br> 	  And for kids and other students that are shy and not really good at socializing or interacting
			<br> 	  with others would lead a bad effect for them and may also lead to depression. 

<br><br><br>
				Now, the negative effects of Modular learning, they're limited to the lessons only given in the module. 
			<br>	Modular learning doesn't have that much negative effects but that is one. But modular learning also has 
			<br>	a positive impact on us, You can do self learning without relying to someone because not any time there's someone 
			<br>	you can rely on. You can see your effort on answering your module. You have enough time to answer and relax (to avoid stress).

<br><br><br>

<h2> <b> GOOD EFFECT </h2> </b>

<br>
	<br> 	  The <p4> Good Effect </p4> is that this is the only way for us to avoid the harm of the covid-19 virus. 
			<br> 	  This is also a help for the parents to reduce their expences. And to take a lot of time with 
			<br> 	  their family and be usefull at their homes. 
<br><br><br>
				Positive effect of online learning. Online learning gives our children a better start.
			<br>	With virtual simulations and models, teachers are able to communicate subjects that may have 
			<br>	previously been out of reach. Video conferencing and social platforms allow students to communicate 
			<br>	with others from different countries and share information like never before. Where the negative 
			<br>	effects of online learning is that the student will likely lose his/her social capabilities, and 
			<br>	will also effect his/her eyesight in a negative manner. The student will lose their social capabilities 
			<br>	because of obvious reasons, first they're just staring a screen all day, second they won't be able to talk 
			<br>	to people in person because they're prohibited to go outside, and the other negative effect is the eyesight, 
			<br>	the reason is. They're STARING at a SCREEN that has RADIATION ALL DAY.

<br><br><br>
			<b> Good effects or Advantages of Modular learning and online Learning Summary </b>
<br><br>


		<br>	Modular and online learning have become the mode of learning since the onset of the pandemic. 
		<br>	This is advantageous on the part of the learners, the teachers, the families of the students 
		<br>	and the global society as a whole. Why? It is because the students and pupils just stay home, 
		<br>	thus keeping them safe from being infected with Covid-19 virus. They will not be carriers or 
		<br>	spreaders of this dreadful disease.

	<br><br>	Another advantage of this is the fact that the learners don't have to hurry to go to school 
		<br>	because they just stay at home to do what is asked for their modules. They can also attend the 
		<br>	lecture class online, and they feel relaxed while viewing on their celphones or their internet. 
		<br>	They don't need to ask for allowance from their parents.

	<br><br>	For me, this is the easiest way to learn. We can finish a course even without going to school.
